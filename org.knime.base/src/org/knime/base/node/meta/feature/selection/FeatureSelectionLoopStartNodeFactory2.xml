	<shortDescription>Start node for a feature selection loop</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node is the start of the feature selection loop. The
			feature selection loop allows you to select, from all the features in
			the input data set, the subset of features that is best for model
			construction. With this node you determine (i) which features/columns
			are to be held fixed in the selection process. These constant or
			"static" features/columns are included in each loop iteration and are
			exempt from elimination; (ii) which selection strategy is to be used
			on the other (variable) features/columns and its settings; and (iii)
			at which
			threshold number of variable features the selection process
			is to
			terminate.
			This node has two in and out ports. The respective
			first
			port is intended for training data and the second port for test
			data.
			The same filter is applied to both tables and they will
			therefore
			always contain the same columns.

		<tab name="General Settings">
			<option name="Static and Variable Features">Columns can be selected manually or by means of
				regular expressions. The columns in the left pane are the static
				columns, those in the right pane the variable columns. Since a
				feature selection process always has a target feature and a set of
				features to select from, there will always be at least one static
				column and more than one variable column. If you leave the left pane
				empty and run the node, you will get a warning. Columns can be moved
				from one pane to the other by clicking on the appropriate button in
				the middle.
			</option>
			<option name="Feature selection strategy">
				Here you can choose between the selection strategies: Forward
				Feature Selection, Backward Feature Elimination, and
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">Genetic Algorithm</a>
				.
			</option>
			<option name="Use threshold for number of features">
				Check this option if you want to set a bound for
				the number of selected
				features. Since Forward Feature Selection adds
				features while
				Backward Feature Elimination subtracts them, this will
				be an upper
				bound for Forward Feature Selection and a lower bound for
				Backward
				Feature Elimination. For Genetic Feature Selection it will
				be
				an upper bound, but while the
				genetic algorithm tries its best
				ensuring that this bound is not
				exceeded, it cannot ensure this.
			</option>
			<option name="Select threshold for number of features">
				Set the upper or lower bound for the number of
				selected features.
			</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Genetic Algorithm">
			<option name="Population size">Defines the number of individuals in each
				population.
			</option>
			<option name="Number of generations">
				Defines the number of generations. The upper bound of number of
				iterations is
				<i>Population size * Number of generations</i>
				,but usually less are needed.
			</option>
			<option name="Selection strategy">
				Defines the strategy to use for the
				<a

				.
			</option>
			<option name="Crossover strategy">
				Defines the strategy to use for
				<a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)"> crossover</a>
				.
			</option>
			<option name="Crossover rate">
				Defines the crossover rate used to alter
				offspring.
			</option>
			<option name="Mutation rate">
				Defines the mutation rate used to alter
				offspring.
			</option>
			<option name="Elitism rate"> Defines the rate of how many of the best
				individuals of a generation are transfered to the next generation
				without alteration.
			</option>
			<option name="Use static random seed"> Choose a seed to get reproducible results.
